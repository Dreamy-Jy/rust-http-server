# Final Project Write-up

These Headings are steps in the process.

# Single Request Handling

Requirements:

- TCP - HTTP - WebSocket Server
- Sending: Files, JSON

Steps:

- Set up

Learning:

- What is & how does TCP/ip work?
    - Difference between IPv4 and IPv6
- What does RAW TCP response look like?
- The [HTTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112) and [WebSocket](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) Protocols
    - [WebSocket Browser API](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/#the-websocket-interface)
    - [MDN HTTP Resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Resources_and_specifications)
- Linux and TCP?
    - Whats the history here?
    - When did TCP come out and why?
    - When did linux come out and why?
    - How does the os handle networking
    - All linux systems use sockets as a abstraction over networking.
        - This abstraction connects networking to the linux file system.
        - Linux uses files an a abstraction over a ton of stuff.
    - Manual Pages used

        - Password less web authentication system. Web sessions project

There is no C client for opentelemetry so I will not use one.

For the rust and maybe the golang implementations Iâ€™ll use one.

    - Getting the full request
    - Parse the request
    - routing the request
    - Building the response

# Single Request Graceful Failure

Signal

- Address all proper kill signals
- Add File Serving
- Add Telemetry

# Multiple Request Handling

Can I write a rust program that put a single thread on my 10-core cpu.

1 parent controller thread

9 child processor thread
